									<h2>Research Interests</h2>
									<p>My research interests lie on trying to improve the hydrological and hydraulic modeling processes occurring in drainage systems. The current models that represent the hydrological and hydraulics of drainage systems were developed many years ago. Even though the scientific foundations of these models were well formulated, many of them were limited by the available computational capacity at that time.</p>
									<p>New technologies can be implemented within the hydrological modeling processes, such as reanalysis data and machine learning techniques to fill missing data. For the hydraulic processes, more robust solvers that considers finer spatial & temporal discretization as well as the effects of air entrainment can be employed to increase the accuracy of estimating pressures within pipes and manholes. Additionally, my interest is to always develop impactful and cheap technologies focusing in the needs of undeveloped and developing countries.</p>
